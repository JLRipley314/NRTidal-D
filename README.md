# NRTidal-D

Analysis of the dissipative tidal deformability from gravitational wave (GW) strain data. 
For more details of our analysis, see the accompanying paper (see the `Citation` at the bottom). 

1. `Waveform model`: Scripts for our waveform model (including the marginalized binary Love relations) 
2. `Injection-Recovery`: Scripts to run Bayesian analysis of injection/recovery analysis for different GW detector networks.  
3. `GW170817-Recovery`: Scripts to perform Bayesian analysis of GW170817 GW strain data. 
3. `ASD-Files`: Amplitude strain data files (for different gravitational wave detector networks). 

# GW170817 Data 

We used the glitch removed strain data, which can be accessed [here](https://gwosc.org/events/GW170817/).
